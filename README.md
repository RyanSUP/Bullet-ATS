# Bullet ATS ðŸ”« 

__*This is a learning project*__ ðŸ“š

Bullet ATS is a full stack web application developed to help beat those pesky ATS robots. It features full CRUD functionality for a list of resume bullets, allows users to filter through bullets by key words, and provides a button to copy the bullet to your clipboard.

## Project inspiration

I'm often changing my resume bullet points ever so slightly, just to match an exact term in a job description. 

I thought: "Wouldn't it be nice if I could save all these and easily find them for future use?"

Bullet ATS is born.

## Learning outcomes

This was a great project to hone some react concepts I had recently learned:

* Better state managment and code readability by using 'smart' and 'dumb' components. Smart components manage state while dumb components manage style.
* Improve import readability with 'barreling' imports.
* Reflect user changes to data on the client end, in state, rather than waiting for the server to update and respond. This improves performance and provides a smoother user experience.
